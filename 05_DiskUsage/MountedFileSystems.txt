What are Mounted File systems.

In Linux, mounted file systems are storage volumes or devices that have been made accessible to 
the operating system and its users by attaching them to a directory in the existing file system 
hierarchy. Mounting a file system means integrating it into the file system structure so that its 
contents can be accessed and manipulated through the standard file system operations.

Key concepts:
------------

1. Mount point:
--------------
    A directory in the existing file system where a new file system will be attached.
    It acts as a entry point to access the mounted file system.

2. File System:
---------------
    A method for storing and organizing files on a storage device. 
    Ex: ext4, NTFS and FAT32

3. Mounting:
------------
    The process of attaching file system to a mount point so that it becomes part of overall file 
    system hierarchy.

4. Unmounting:
-------------
The process of detaching a mounted file system from its mount point, making it no longer accessible 
at that location.

Common commands:
---------------

View mounted File Systems:
command: df(disk free) -h(human-readable)

It provides information about the available and used disk space on filesystems.

which makes the output easier to understand by displaying sizes in KB, MB, GB, etc., rather than 
in the default block size (usually 1K blocks).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Command: mount.
This command shows all currently mounted file systems and their mount points.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mount a file system:

Command: /dev/sdX1 /mnt/mydisk

This command mounts the file system on the device /dev/sdX1 to the directory /mnt/mydisk.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Unmount a File System:

Command: unmount /mnt/mydisk
This command unmounts the file system mounted at /mnt/mydisk.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Examples of Mounted File Systems:
---------------------------------

Local Disk Partitions:
Mounted under directories like /, /home, /var, etc.

External Storage Devices:
Such as USB drives, mounted under /media or /mnt.

Network File Systems:
Such as NFS (Network File System) or SMB (Server Message Block), mounted under directories like /mnt/nfs or /mnt/smb.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Typical Mount Points:
--------------------
Root File System: /
Home Directory: /home
Temporary Storage: /tmp
External Drives: /media/usb or /mnt/external

Story: The Village Library.

Setting:
You live in a small village where thereâ€™s a local library. This library is a great place where 
people can borrow and return books. Imagine that the library is connected to various storage rooms 
(file systems) where different categories of books are kept.

Characters:

The Library (Root File System): This is the main building where the library services are provided.
Storage Rooms (Mount Points): These are different rooms in the library where books are categorized. 
Each room represents a different file system.
Books (Files): These are the items you want to access or organize.
Scenario 1: Adding a New Storage Room (Mounting a File System)
The Situation:
The library wants to add a new storage room to keep all the science fiction books. This new room is 
an external building that needs to be integrated into the existing library system.

What Happens:

    Mount Point Creation:
    The library decides to use a section of the main building, like a hallway, as an entry point to 
    the new storage room. They call this hallway "Science Fiction Room."

    Mounting the Room:
    The new storage room (external file system) is physically connected to the library. 
    Now, when people enter the hallway marked "Science Fiction Room," they can access the 
    science fiction books stored in that new room.

    Command: mount /dev/sdX1 /mnt/science_fiction

    Here, /dev/sdX1 represents the new storage room, and /mnt/science_fiction is the hallway 
    (mount point) where the room is connected.

-------------------------------------

Scenario 2: Accessing the Books

The Situation:
    A librarian needs to organize the science fiction books.

        What Happens:
            Access the Books:
                The librarian goes to the "Science Fiction Room" (the mount point) and starts 
                working with the books. 
                They can now see and manage the books that were stored in the new room.

                Commands:
                cd /mnt/science_fiction
                ls

                Here, cd changes to the directory of the new room, and ls lists the books (files) 
                available in that room.
------------------------------------------

Scenario 3: Removing the Storage Room (Unmounting a File System)

The Situation:
    The library needs to temporarily close the science fiction room for renovation.
        What Happens:
            Unmount the Room:
                The connection between the hallway and the new storage room is temporarily removed. 
                The hallway no longer leads to the science fiction room, so the books are not 
                accessible through that hallway anymore.
            
            Command:
            umount /mnt/science_fiction
----------------------------------------------

Summary:
Mount Point: Like a hallway in the library where you connect to a new storage room.
Mounted File System: The new storage room connected to the library.
Mounting: Integrating a new storage room into the library system.
Unmounting: Temporarily disconnecting the storage room from the library system.
