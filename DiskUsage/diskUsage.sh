# The command to know the disk usage of system is 'df -hT'

df -hT

# Explaination:

# The df command in Linux stands for "disk free". 
# It provides information about the available and used disk space on filesystems.

# The -h option stands for "human-readable", which makes the output easier to understand by 
# displaying sizes in KB, MB, GB, etc., rather than in the default block size (usually 1K blocks).

# -T stands for (Type).
# Displays the type of filesystem.
